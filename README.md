### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jessica, a Senior Delivery Manager at [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com) who loves technology.

I write blog posts, such as the one [here](https://medium.com/@jessica.nichols_20772/time-management-during-a-global-pandemic-8f9b47788388) and speak at digital festivals too, [here](https://youtu.be/aTzwsmScC64) is a talk where I talked about delivering a user-centred NHS virtual visit service during COVID-19, including a live demo!
